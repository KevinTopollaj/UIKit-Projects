## Architecture

MVC is a widely used architectural pattern in iOS development. It separates the application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.

The Model component handles data storage and processing, while the View component encompasses the visual elements of the application. The Controller mediates between the Model and View, updating the Model based on user input and updating the View with the appropriate data output.

MVC enables developers to build complex and scalable applications by providing a structured and organized development process. Its efficient and effective approach to application development has made it a popular choice among iOS developers.
